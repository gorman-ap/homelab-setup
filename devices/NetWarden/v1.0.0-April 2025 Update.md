# NetWarden & NetSentry Major Overhaul

- **Current as of : 2025-05-15**

## Overview
This document outlines the purpose, rationale, and high-level structure of the NetWarden and NetSentry migration and maintenance setup. Configuration details and individual playbooks are tracked in a separate repository.



## Purpose of Migration

### Why NetWarden Was Chosen as Core
- **Always-on reliability**: NetWarden runs 24/7 and is rack-mounted with UPS protection.
- **Centralized control**: Ideal location to run Ansible, Netdata, Pi-hole (primary DNS + DHCP), Chrony (NTP), and backups.
- **Higher performance**: More robust hardware than Pi devices, with NVMe storage and sufficient RAM.

### Why NetSentry Exists
- **Redundancy**: Acts as secondary DNS resolver for resilience.
- **DNS security**: Runs Unbound for recursive DNS resolution.
- **Lightweight backup target**: Low-resource Pi configured to serve DNS queries and act as a fallback.

### Why SignalShieldVPN was Decomissioned
- Retired in favor of NetSentry for clarity and tighter scope.
- VPN role was deprioritized; DNS and Unbound roles were split off and hardened.
- Device was repurposed as a learning tool.

---

## Migration Goals
- Eliminate single points of failure in DNS and DHCP.
- Automate updates and backups across always-on infrastructure.
- Ensure configuration is version-controlled and easy to restore.
- Unify NTP, DNS, and config management under Ansible-driven automation.

---

## Devices
- **NetWarden**
  - Ubuntu Server
  - Pi-hole (primary DNS + DHCP)
  - Chrony (NTP server)
  - Netdata, Loki, Promtail
  - Ansible control node

- **NetSentry**
  - Raspberry Pi (formerly SignalShieldVPN)
  - Pi-hole (secondary DNS)
  - Unbound DNS resolver

---

## System Design Summary
- NetWarden backs up config files weekly.
- NetSentry backs up Pi-hole and Unbound configs weekly.
- Both devices are included in the Ansible `[autoupdate]` group and receive weekly OS/security updates.
- Logs and backups are timestamped and stored to `/mnt/NetWarden-Backups/` and `~/ansible/logs/`
- NetWarden serves as the authoritative NTP server for the network.
- All config file backups and Ansible roles are tracked in a separate Git repository.
